# Concrete Grammar:

Grammar is very similar to python, except for a few things:

must declare variable with life: life <variableName> = <value>

<value> can be number, string, function call, input, binary experssions

statemets:
if statement: life(<expression>) { block <elif or else stmt>}

elif statement: stem(<expression>) {block <elif or else stmt>}

else statement: root(<expression>) {block}

while statemnet: cycle(<expression>) {block}

for statement: grow <variable> range(<expression>){block}

print: plant(<expression>)

input: load(<expression>)

function def: birth <functionName> (<parameters>){block}


The boolean True is expressed as Nature

The boolean False is expressed as Technology

The and statement can be expressed as and or &

The or statement can be expressed as or or |


converting between types, such as int, float, string, and boolean are availible
